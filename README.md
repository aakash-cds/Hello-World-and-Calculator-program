# 🧪 Experiment 1 - Hello World & Basic Calculator

## 🎯 Aim:
To understand and implement:
- The basic structure of a C++ program
- Console input/output using `cin` and `cout`
- Fundamental data types and variables
- Arithmetic operations using operators

---

## 🧠 Theory:

C++ is a statically-typed, general-purpose programming language that supports procedural as well as object-oriented programming. Every C++ program must contain a `main()` function, which acts as the starting point of the program.

### ➤ C++ Program Structure:
A typical C++ program includes:
- `#include <iostream>`: To use input and output streams
- `using namespace std;`: To avoid using `std::` prefix
- `int main() { ... }`: Main function where the code execution begins

### ➤ Data Types:
Common C++ data types include:
| Data Type | Description          | Example   |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------|
| `int`     | Integer numbers       | 1, -3, 42 |
| `float`   | Decimal numbers       | 3.14, 0.5 |
| `char`    | Single character      | 'A', 'z'  |
| `bool`    | Boolean value         | true/false |

### ➤ Operators:
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

- Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Assignment: `=`
- Comparison: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` (used in later experiments)

## ⚙️ Procedure:
1. Open your preferred C++ IDE (Code::Blocks / VS Code / OnlineGDB).
2. Create a new `.cpp` file and name it appropriately.
3. Write the C++ program using the basic structure:
   - Use `#include <iostream>` and `using namespace std;`
   - Use the `main()` function as the entry point
4. For the Hello World program:
   - Display a message using `cout`
5. For the calculator:
   - Accept two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
   - Use `if-else` statements to determine the operation
   - Display the result using `cout`
6. Compile and run the program
7. Observe the output and verify correctness

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes:
- Understood the structure of a valid C++ program
- Gained experience with input and output operations
- Practiced declaring and using different data types
- Performed basic arithmetic using operators
- Applied decision-making logic using conditional statements

---

## 📌 Key Concepts Covered:
- C++ syntax and structure
- Standard input/output
- Variables and data types
- Arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic (`if-else`)

## 📝 Experiment Summary:
This experiment introduced the essentials of writing and executing a C++ program. By building two simple programs — one to display "Hello, World!" and another to simulate a basic calculator — the foundational concepts of input/output, data types, and control flow were reinforced. This sets the stage for more advanced experiments involving decision-making, loops, and bitwise operations.
